## v0.4.0 - 2023-09-08

### Added

* Added `scriptEnvFile` to command object that allows one to specify an environment file (or any file really) when a `scriptFile` is run. Inspired by the practice of keeping environment variables and scripts or commands seperate.
* Basis for listing commands

### Changed

* BREAKING: Notifications object now takes the form of service.id, where service can be "mail" or "matrix" and id is a unique id for the service.
* BREAKING: Since the change to the notifications object, cmd-lists' inner map key 'notifications' must be of the form service.id. id must be defined for that service. See notifications docs for aviliable services.
* Config parser is now the simpler Koanf - Keys are now case-sensitive
* Log size limited to 50 Mb
